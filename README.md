# Game

A very simple JS game I've built with my 5-yr old son

# Playing

Just clone the project and run it from a local server.

I use to run pure HTML/JS projects with PHP built-in webserver, this way:

    $ php -S localhost:8000

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` *et voi lรก*.

Use arrows to move the character up (jump), left and right. And try to catch the ball.
